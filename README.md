# Introduction
Vulkron is an abstraction of Vulkan in C++. As mentioned in the main [repository](https://github.com/bisqq/LegacyEngine) we use C as the foundation when commincating with the hardware and C++ as the main engine programming language for a higher level abstraction. Since Vulkan is already written in C for GPU communication we only need to write it in C++ for the API to successfully operate.

Vulkron is also going to be written in a way were we can export it as a dll/lib file (for future use).
